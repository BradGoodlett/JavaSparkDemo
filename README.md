## Java Interview
The code in the Java Interview folder is for problem 1. I was unable to add the pdf to the repository, so I have copied the problem below:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
### Example 1:
Input: s = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] \
Output: ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']

### Example 2:
Input: s = ['H', 'a', 'n', 'n', 'a', 'h'] \
Output: ['h', 'a', 'n', 'n', 'a', 'H'] 


## Spark
The code in the spark folder is for problem 4 using Java Spark. 

Given a big file in HDFS file system, you need to find if a particular keyword exists in that file or not.

Example 1: Check for the keyword "Christmas"
Input: [ file that contains keyword ] \
Output: Keyword "Christmas" exists in the given file.
